Vision
===

Our vision for [ESFiddle](https://esfiddle.net) is to provide a test bench for the newest ECMAScript features.
We want to encourage usage of these features by a rich library of example code. 
Our focus centers around the education and experimentation of new ECMAScript features that people can share with their friends.

#### ESFiddle Release Roadmaps
For each version of ESFiddle you can see the roadmap and discussion of features and fixes that will go into that version.
