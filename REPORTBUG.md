# How to Report a Bug

Thank you for taking the effort to report an issue.

If you think you've found a bug, please follow these steps to resolve your problem:

1. If the page seems broken in any way, try to do a Hard Refresh (see on the bottom of this file) of the page.
   This will update any old code that may have been cached in your browser.

   * If your code crashes your browser, also try Clearing Your Browser's Local Storage.

2. Try [searching for your issue on gitHub](https://github.com/esfiddle/esfiddle/labels/up-for-grabs) too see if anyone else
   has posted about a similar issue about the bug you have found too.
   If someone has, you can upvote the issue by replying to it with "+1" as your message.

3. If you can't find any relevant issues on GitHub, then create a new issue (see below)
   and our development team will take a look at your problem.

   * Please **wait** 3rd party confirmation of your problem.

### Create a New Issue

Crafting a good issue will make it much easier for the dev team to replicate and resolve your problem.
Follow these steps to do it right:

1. Go to our [gitHub Issues page](https://github.com/esfiddle/esfiddle/labels/up-for-grabs) and click on **New Issue**.
2. **Have a useful title**
   * Write a meaningful title that describes the issue.
     Some good examples are _Logging in from the News and Field Guide pages doesn't redirect properly (using e-mail)_
     and _Typo: "for" instead of "while" loop_; bad examples include _A bug, HELP!!!11_ and _I found this bug in a Challenge_.

   * Keep the title relatively short, the description is for further information.
     One example is to shorten long Challenge names, so instead of writing _Test case bug in 'Challenge: Check Radio Buttons and Checkboxes by Default'_,
     you might want to write _Test case bug in 'Radio Buttons' Challenge_.
3. In the body, **provide a link** to the page on which you encountered this issue.
4. Describe the problem and provide steps so that a developer can try to replicate the issue. Include your operating system and browser version.
   * When referencing other issues or pull requests, simply write #issue/pr-number.
5. **Take a screenshot** of the issue and include it in the post.
6. Click **Submit New Issue** and you are done! You will be automatically subscribed to notifications for any updates or future comments.

### Hard Refresh

You may have to do a "hard refresh" of a page in your browser if you have an out of date, cached version of that website.

While on the problematic site use the key combination below to trigger a hard refresh depending on your operating system:

* <sub> Windows: CTRL + F5 </sub>
* <sub> Mac/Apple: Apple + Shift + R or Command + Shift + R </sub>
* <sub> Linux: F5 </sub>

If a hard refresh doesn't work, try opening the problematic page in your browser's private browsing mode.
